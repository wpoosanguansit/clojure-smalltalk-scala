This is an exercise to use multiple languages to perform simple computations.

For SmallTalk, Squeak-4.5-All-in-One is used as the VM.

Place the image and changeset into the folder where VM source is found.
Launching. To start Squeak, do whatever your operating system expects: drag the .image file onto the icon of the virtual machine, or double-click the .image file, or at the command line type the name of the virtual machine followed by the path to the .image file.

For Scala, install sbt 0.13.2 and run the program from sbt commands like console.

For Clojure, use leiningen and run the program by running lein run -f <path to file>
